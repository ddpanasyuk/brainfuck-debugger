Use this program to debug your brainfuck programs

You'll need to compile / link with the ncurses library under mac/unix
or pdcurses to compile / link under windows.

To run, pass "-f <filename>" as an argument to load
a bf script from a file and "-d \"<brainfuck script>\""
to run direct bf script.

Once it's launched, press 'h' for a list of commands
and their descriptions.

Enjoy!
